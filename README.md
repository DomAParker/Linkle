# Linkle
One weekend, when I was down in Cornwall visiting my parents, I wanted to build something using JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

My mum was doing a puzzle called Missing Links in a puzzle book, whilst talking to Dad about the Wordle that day. After realising how much my mum enjoyed both the Wordle and Missing Links, I said to Mum I'll create a Wordle-like game, but one that is based off her favourite Missing Links puzzle.

Over the weekend I quickly got a prototype up and running, and after a few weeks of tweaking the styling, adding in tutorials, stats tracking and the like, I put Linkle live as my first ever website.

You can access it via [this link - Linkle](https://linkle.uk), and try it out.

It is built with standard JavaScript, CSS and HTML. It uses local storage to keep a player's stats and past guesses, to create an experience similar to Wordle.

I hope you enjoy playing it!
